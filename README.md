# ContinuumAI-SIM-AI-Ignition-Hackathon-2025-Team-30-
1st Runner-up submission for Singapore's first youth agentic AI hackathon
This platform was made strictly for educational purpose and was made using Bolt.new.

ContinuumAI is a platform mock up I built tailored to marketing teams in early stage SaaS startups that automates social media and content ops through assisted content planning, copywriting, asset resizing, machine learning, ai content generation features and accessibility to other image generation platforms to combat manual and time consuming content creation. This platform is versatile and could be a platform template used for other industries and teams to streamline processes.
